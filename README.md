# Fitness Tracker

This project lets you view create and track daily workouts. You are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. You will also able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, you will be able to track your distance traveled.

## Description

Motivation for this project to be able to route functionality and allow button clicks AND user input to be considered to then used for outputting information for the user.
I built this project to be able to test whether or not user input could be taken and used logged with multiple input options.
The problem that this project solves is now being able to neatly analyze your workouts (in terms of Resistance or Cardio workouts) and help you keep track of how well you are doing!
I learned how to connect routes a bit better, handle event functions better, see how 'duration' is effective in tracking, and see how I could have a website keep track of an amount of something!
